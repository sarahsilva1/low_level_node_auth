# low_level_node_auth
Very basic authentication app using node.js.  

This project helped me gain an understanding of how authentication works at a low level.  
It's a simple authentication app that connects to MongoDB and uses manual sessions, bcrypt, csurf, and mongoose. 

I created it through the help of this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvviEA1pOXw
